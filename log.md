# 100-days-of-Code

Day 0  01/03/2018
 Today´s progress: I´ve started from scratch, learning how to code HTML at the FreeCodeCamp. Eventhough I have an account and started
 few months ago, I want to start again! @!_!@
 
 Thoughts: I´ve read about the 100 days of code challenge, so it made me think about getting into it with confidence. 
 Thanks Alexander Kallaway to foster confidence and commitment. 
 
 Setbacks:No setbacks, just learning "new" concepts!
